Welcome to Zergio's Feature Selection Algorithm
Type in the name of the file to test: Type the number of the algorithm you want to run.
   1) Forward Selection
   2) Backward Elimination (FIXME)

This dataset has 40 features (not including the class attribute), with 1000 instances.
Running nearest neighbor with sets of all 40 features, using "leaving-one-out" evaluation.
